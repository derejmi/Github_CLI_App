# Github Repo CLI App

- Created a CLI App with Object Oriented design:
  - On starting the app, User is asked for their GitHub username
  - A request is made to `https://api.github.com/users/<username>/repos`
  - API data is turned into instances of Repository class
  - User is shown a numbered list their repos by name
  - User can input a number to see more details on the corresponding repository
